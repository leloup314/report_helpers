# report_helpers
A collection of methods and classes written in Python, intended to simplify writing lab reports.
The main feature so far is a plotting/fitting routine.
The code is still messy since I did not plan on sharing it. In the future it is foreseen to:
- Clean-up code and fix bugs
- Implement a plotting class from the plot() method

The following packages are required:
```
numpy scipy matplotlib
```
